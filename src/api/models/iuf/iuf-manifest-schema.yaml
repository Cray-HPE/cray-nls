$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
title: "Product Manifest for HPE CSM Install-Upgrade Framework (IUF)"
description: >
  A manifest that defines the behavior of the IUF when it performs operations
  against this product.


  This manifest file must be named iuf-product-manifest.yaml in the top level
  of the product release distribution in order for it to be discovered by the
  IUF.
# This is the version of the IUF manifest schema itself
version: 0.2.0
type: object
required:
- iuf_version
- name
# TODO: Generally would like this throughout all objects as it provides more
# guarantee of backwards compatibility of old manifests with newer schema.
#
# Using additionalProperties false helps ensure backwards compatibility of old
# IUF manifest files with newer schema versions because old manifest files will
# not be able to use additional properties which are then later added to the IUF
# manifest schema.

  iuf_version:
    description: >
      The semantic version of the IUF with which this manifest file is expected
      to be compatible. Version constraints can be specified using ">", ">=",
      "==", "<", and "<=" comparison operators. Multiple comparison operators
      can be used to specify a range.


      Version constraints can also be specified with "~" (tilde) and "^" (caret)
      operators. A full version prefixed with "~" means that all versions with the
      same major and minor versions are compatible. That is, the patch version
      is allowed to differ. A full version prefixed with "^" means that all versions
      with the same major version are compatible. That is, the minor and patch
      versions are allowed to differ.


      It is recommended that products specify a caret range matching the
      current version of the IUF against which the manifest is developed. This
      will allow the manifest to continue working with new minor and patch
      versions of the IUF.
    type: string
    examples:
    - 1.0.0
    - ">= 1.0.0 < 2.0"
    - "< 2.0"
    - "~1.0.0"
    - "^1.0.0"

  name:
    description: >
      The abbreviated name of the product. This product name is the name under
      which the product will be uploaded to the product catalog.

    examples:
    - cos
    - sat
    - analytics
    # TODO: Consider a regular expression for allowed product names
    # pattern: <regex in ECMA-262 regular expression dialect goes here>

  description:
    description: >
      A description of the product.
    type: string

  version:
    description: >
      The version of the product. If not specified, the IUF will look for a
      file named ".version" in the top level of the release distribution
      directory.  If the version is not specified in the manifest, and there is
      no ".version" file, an attempt to install the product using the IUF will
      fail.

      It is recommended that products use a version string format which
      conforms to the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Spec. This does not require
      that the version numbers be assigned and incremented in accordance with
      the rules and requirements dictated by SemVer.

      If the product provides Ansible configuration content which is uploaded to a
      vcs repository (see the "vcs" property), then the version here must be a
      valid semantic version.
    type: string
    examples:
    - 2.4.76
    - 22.9.4
    - 1.3.0-rc.3
    - 2.5.8-20221004160837-9746d6e
    # If we can enforce that every product uses SemVer, then we can use the
    # following official regex from the FAQ on semver.org.
    # pattern: '^(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:-((?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)(?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))*))?(?:\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$'

  content:
    type: object
    description: >
      The content delivered by this product, including container images, RPMs,
      package repositories, helm charts, loftsman manifests, VCS repositories,
      IMS images and recipes, and S3 artifacts.

      Note that if the layout of the content is not specified in this manifest,
      the IUF will assume a default layout as defined in the property
      descriptions here.

      Any time a "relative path" is mentioned in the descriptions of properties
      beneath "content", it means a path relative to the top level of the
      product release distribution file.

                The directories contained within the directory specified here
                must contain container images. The container images will be
                uploaded to Nexus with names exactly matching the full path to
                the directory containing the image manifest.json file.

                For example, if this path contains the following file structure

          upload\_content stage of the install/upgrade. They will be used from
          this S3 location during the deploy\_manifests stage of the install.

          If the loftsman manifests are customized with the contents of
          customizations.yaml using manifestgen, then both the pre-customization
