  A manifest that defines the details of the repos that should be 
  uploaded to nexus repository

  This file must be named nexus-repositories.yaml in the top level
  of the product release distribution in order for it to be discovered by the
  IUF.
# This is the version of the nexus_repository schema itself
version: 0.0.1
type: object

# TODO: Generally would like this throughout all objects as it provides more
# guarantee of backwards compatibility of old manifests with newer schema.
#
# Using additionalProperties false helps ensure backwards compatibility of old
# IUF manifest files with newer schema versions because old manifest files will
# not be able to use additional properties which are then later added to the IUF
# manifest schema.
