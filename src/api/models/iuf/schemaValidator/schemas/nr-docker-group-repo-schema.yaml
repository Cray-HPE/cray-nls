# TODO: Generally would like this throughout all objects as it provides more
# guarantee of backwards compatibility of old manifests with newer schema.
#
# Using additionalProperties false helps ensure backwards compatibility of old
# IUF manifest files with newer schema versions because old manifest files will
# not be able to use additional properties which are then later added to the IUF
# manifest schema.
